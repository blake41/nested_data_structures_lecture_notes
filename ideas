What are the scoping implications of nested data structures?
-modifying one piece modifies the larger whole (intuitive)
-variables overwriting other variables (naming block variables the same as another variable)

How do we iterate inside an iteration?

How do we deal with the case where we want to insert something into an array but the first time there exists no array, or increment a counter in a hash
